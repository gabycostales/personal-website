# Gaby's Website

This is my first forray into Nuxt, so judge lightly!

## Future Roadmap

Here are some things I want to do / add to this site:

- [ ] Add lightbox module to show a gallery of some of my projects described on the CV page
- [ ] Page to describe tech used on this website build
- [ ] More Three.js renderings!

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
This is a Nuxt project!
For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
